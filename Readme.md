# 🚗 Used Car Price Modeling — CRISP-DM Data Science Project

This project applies the **CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** methodology to analyze and model **used car resale prices**.  
The workflow covers all stages from business understanding to model evaluation and deployment, implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

**Notebook:** `practical_application_2.ipynb`  
**Objective:** Predict used car resale prices and uncover the most influential factors affecting market value.

**Highlights:**
- Implements all **CRISP-DM** stages.  
- Uses multiple **machine learning models** for regression and classification.  
- Includes **ARIMA time-series forecasting**.  
- Saves all graphs automatically in an `images/` folder.  
- Provides runtime summaries and business insights.

## 🧹 CRISP-DM Framework Implementation

### 1️⃣ Business Understanding

The objective is to develop a reliable ML model to predict used car prices and understand what drives value in the market.
Dealerships can use the model to optimize pricing, improve purchasing strategies, and identify high-margin vehicles.

---

### 2️⃣ Data Understanding

The dataset (`vehicles.csv`) contains ~426,000 listings with attributes like manufacturer, year, mileage, fuel type, and condition.
EDA identifies missing values, outliers, and price drivers such as model year, odometer, and condition.
Visualizations are used to interpret the underlying data patterns.

---

### 3️⃣ Data Preparation

Steps include:

* Dropping irrelevant columns (`id`, `VIN`).
* Handling missing values for categorical and numeric features.
* Encoding categorical variables with `OneHotEncoder`.
* Scaling numerical data with `StandardScaler`.
* Reducing high-cardinality columns (`manufacturer`, `model`, `region`) to top 20 categories.

A preprocessing pipeline automates these transformations efficiently.

---

### 4️⃣ Modeling

Trains several models:

* **Linear Regression** – Baseline model for interpretability.
* **Ridge Regression** – Adds regularization to control overfitting.
* **Lasso Regression** – Performs automatic feature selection.
* **Logistic Regression** – Classifies cars as *high* vs *low price*.
* **ARIMA (1,0,1)** – Forecasts average price trends over time.

Each model’s metrics and training time are recorded for comparison.

📌 **Note on Cross-Validation:**
K-Fold validation uses **`cv=2`** instead of a dynamic value to reduce training time, since the dataset is large (~380k rows).
This ensures reasonable runtime without sacrificing model validation integrity.

---

### 5️⃣ Evaluation

Models are evaluated with:

* **Regression:** R² and RMSE
* **Classification:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, and ROC-AUC

Performance metrics are summarized in a consolidated table, and the best-performing model is selected automatically.

---

### 6️⃣ Deployment / Business Insights

The notebook saves all outputs and charts in an `images/` folder.
A concise summary dashboard lists model results, timings, and insights.
The final section includes business recommendations derived from modeling results.

## 💡 Business Insights & Recommendations

* Newer cars and lower mileage strongly increase resale value.
* Ridge Regression provides stable continuous predictions.
* Logistic Regression effectively identifies premium vehicles with high probability.
* ARIMA shows a steady upward price trend over recent years.
* Dealerships should prioritize **low-mileage, newer, clean-condition vehicles** for better margins.
